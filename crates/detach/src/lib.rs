//! Detached instances for termide.
//!
//! A detached instance is an ordinary termide running inside a PTY owned by a
//! daemonised parent. Clients attach to that daemon over a unix socket and
//! pump bytes; closing a client leaves the daemon, the hosted termide and
//! everything it spawned — shells, LSP servers, watchers — untouched.
//!
//! The split is deliberate. Nothing about the running instance is serialised,
//! so nothing can be lost in translation: reattaching re-enters the terminal
//! modes and repaints, and the state was never anywhere but in the still-live
//! process.
//!
//! Unix only. Windows has no `fork`/`setsid` and its ConPTY model needs a
//! different host, so the CLI surface is compiled out there.
